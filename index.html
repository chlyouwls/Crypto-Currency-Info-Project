                    <p class="lead my-4">Decentralized networks are made up of computers, also known as<span class="text-warning"> nodes</span> that interact on a direct, peer-to-peer basis, without the need for third parties. Within a decentralized network, information is distributed to every single “node” on the network. Each node has an updated copy of all recorded data. Decentralized networks can also distribute data so that certain private information can be validated without that information being transferred to a third party. Data is validated by using an agreed-upon consensus mechanism, which often involves the other computers on the network checking the validity of the data before it becomes permanently imprinted onto a blockchain.</p>

                <p class="lead my-4">Traditionally, a wallet is a small folding case for carrying paper money, credit cards, and other flat objects. And while many believe that a cryptocurrency wallet has the exact same characteristics as a traditional wallet, in reality, it functions differently.</p>
                <p class="lead my-4">Bitcoin lives as a record of transactions on the blockchain. Bitcoin never leaves the blockchain, so, in essence, a cryptocurrency wallet is somewhat of a misnomer as it does not store the digital currency.</p>
                <p class="lead my-4">Instead, <span class="text-warning">your Bitcoin wallet is a tool that interacts with the BitcoinSV blockchain to send, receive, and manage the Bitcoin assigned to addresses. </span>When a person sends Bitcoin, they are transferring possession of the coins from one address to another.</p>

            </h1>
            <p class="lead my-4">The crypto wallet stores private and public keys that interact with the BitcoinSV network. An alphanumeric identifier is generated based on the public and private keys. This identifier is commonly known as the “address” because it refers to a specific location on the blockchain. This address is what parties give to one another in order to transact using Bitcoin.</p>
            <p class="lead my-4">The private key stored must have ownership of the public address. To complete a Bitcoin transaction, the public and private keys must match. The transaction is signed by the sender and recorded on the Bitcoin (SV) blockchain. Once that happens, the balance of the receiver will increase, and the sender’s decreases accordingly. The private keys must never be disclosed, or else the party risks having their Bitcoin stolen.</p>
